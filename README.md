## History of Pizza

Pizza has a rich and tasty history 🍞🌿. Ancient civilizations in the Mediterranean enjoyed flatbreads topped with herbs and oils. The modern pizza we know today was born in Naples, Italy 🇮🇹 in the 18th century, with simple toppings like tomatoes 🍅, cheese 🧀, and basil 🌿. Italian immigrants later brought pizza to the world 🌍, especially to the United States 🇺🇸, where it evolved into countless styles and flavors 🍕🔥. Today, pizza is loved by millions everywhere, from classic Margheritas to bold, creative creations! 🎉
